# bank_customers_churn_prediction_exploring_7_different_classification_algorithms

## This project deals with the classification of the bank customers on whether a customer will leave the bank (i.e.; churn) or not, by applying the below steps of a Data Science Project Life-Cycle.

## 1. Data Exploration, Analysis and Visualisations 
## 2. Data Pre-processing 
## 3. Data Preparation for the Modelling 
## 4. Model Training 
## 5. Model Validation 
## 6. Optimized Model Selection based on Various Performance Metrics 
## 7. Deploying the Best Optimized Model into Unseen Test Data 
## 8. Evaluating the Optimized Modelâ€™s Performance Metrics  

## The business case of determining the churn status of bank customers are explored, trained and validated on 7 different classification algorithms/models as listed below and the best optimized model is selected based on the various performance metrics namely accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.  

## 1. Decision Tree Classifier - CART (Classification and Regression Tree) Algorithm 
## 2. Decision Tree Classifier - IDE (Iterative Dichotomiser) Algorithm 
## 3. Ensemble Random Forest Classifier Algorithm 
## 4. Ensemble Adaptive Boosting Classifier Algorithm 
## 5. Ensemble Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier Algorithm 
## 6. Ensemble Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Classifier Algorithm 
## 7. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier Algorithm
